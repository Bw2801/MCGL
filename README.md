# MCGL
Minecraft Command Generation Library for Java

MCGL is a library written in and for use in Java. This library allows you to write Java code and the library will handle the conversion to valid Minecraft commands.

To use this library download the latest release or compile it from code and add it as a dependency to a newly created Java project. Create a new class extending the MCGL base class Chain and you can start coding!
